## Some experimental prompts for applying GptChat in education

They are highly experimental, and care must be taken to take into account the [limitations](https://www.listendata.com/2022/12/limitations-of-ChatGPT.html) of the technology, particularly the lack of ground-truth and the lack of privacy.
